        On my PC, when I only execute the tests and use getNumberSingle(), it takes 4.646 Seconds to finish.
        But when I run the tests using getNumberParallel it only takes 2.894 Seconds. So getNumberParallel
        is a lot faster.
        It's faster, because two threads are working at the same time. And together they are faster than 
        a single thread.
